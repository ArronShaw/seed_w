* About dataset *

test_pos.fas file contains 1000 random generated DNA sequences length range from 10 - 2000 Nucleotides.

test_neg.fas file contains 1000 DNA sequences generated from the test_pos.fas file using fasta-shuffle-letters.

Note that this dataset has the support of 100% , meaning all the sequences in the positive dataset will contain the one-word motif, the target word is "TTCAAGCTTT".
