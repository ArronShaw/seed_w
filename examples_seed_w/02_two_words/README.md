* About dataset *

test_pos.fas file contains 10000 random generated DNA sequences length range from 10 - 2000 Nucleotides.

test_neg.fas file contains 10000 DNA sequences generated from the test_pos.fas file by using fasta-shuffle-letters.

Note that this dataset has the support of 50% , meaning half of the sequences will contain two of the one-word motif, the target word is "CAAGTACCAT".
