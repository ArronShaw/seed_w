* About dataset *

test_pos.fas file contains 10000 random generated DNA sequences length range from 10 - 2000 Nucleotides.

test_neg.fas file contains 10000 random generated DNA sequences length range from 10 - 2000 Nucleotides.

Note that this dataset has support in the positive dataset of 60 %, and 40% in the negative dataset, meaning 6000 of the sequences in the positive dataset and 4000 of the negative dataset will contain three of the one-word motif, the target word is "GAGTATGATC".
